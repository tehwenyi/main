* Items in square brackets are optional. +
** E.g `n/EXPENSE_NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Chicken Rice t/School` or as `n/Chicken Rice`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times. +
** E.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/school` (1 time), `t/hawker t/school` (2 times) etc.
* Parameters can be in any order. +
