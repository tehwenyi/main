== PROJECT: ePiggy

---

== Overview

ePiggy is a desktop application designed to inculcate good spending habits in students.
ePiggy hopes to make managing money much simpler for you with a simple interface and simple commands!
At the same time, ePiggy offers everything you need to cultivate good spending habits before entering the workforce,
from tracking expenses and managing budgets to setting goals! The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

---

* *Major enhancements*: added *the ability to search and sort for expenses*
** What it does: +
 1. allows the user to search for his/her expenses by either it's `name`, `cost`, `date` and/or `tag` ! +
 2. allows the user to sort his/her expenses by either it's `name`, `cost` or `date` !
** Justification: These features improves the product significantly because: +
1. It becomes more convenient for the user to find a particular expenses or a set of expenses
to figure out where he/she has been spending
2. It becomes more convenient for the user to sort the expenses according to his/her preferences.
For example, if the user wants to find out where he/she has been spending more, the user can sort it by cost.
** Highlights: These enhancements are two of the most user-friendly commands in ePiggy, mainly due to their need and adaptability. +
1. The search feature enhancement have been built on top of the existing functionality. Now it allows multiple keywords search to filter out the
expenses. Furthermore, it allows user to enter a range for date and cost. This implementation was quite challenging as it required the complete modification of the existing command.
2. The sort feature enhancement was built from start to finish. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. This new feature greatly adds to the functionality of existing
commands (that were modified from address-book level 4).

* *Minor enhancement*: modified existing help and list commands.

* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com[RepoSense]] _{https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s2.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#search=rahulb99&sort=displayName&since=2019-02-10&until=2019-04-30&timeframe=day&reverse=false&repoSort=false}_

* *Other contributions*:

** Project management:
*** Managed product releases on GitHub.
*** Set up the issue tracker, user stories, and assigned the milestones.

** Enhancements to existing features:
*** Made `date` an optional keyword while adding an expense
   (so now, if the `date` keyword is missing, `date` takes the value of device's date). (Commit: https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-4/main/pull/135/commits/b974cc12cc700d751de34c80307267d26f5e455e[b974cc] )
*** Wrote base tests for any command related to `expense`, in addtion to `findExpenseCommandTest` and `SortExpenseCommandTest` .
 (Pull requests https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-4/main/pull/135[#135], https://github.com[#00])

=== Filtering and Sorting Data

==== Searching for an expense : `search`

You can search for any expense in the list by specifying either its name, tag, date, range of dates, or range of amount. +
Format: *`findExpense [n/NAME] [t/TAG] [d/DATE_RANGE] [$/AMOUNT RANGE]`* +

Examples:

* `search n/MCDONALDS` +
Displays all entries with the name “MCDONALDS”.
* `search t/FOOD` +
Displays all entries with the tag specified (in this case, it’s food).
* `search d/2019/01/02` +
Displays all entries listed on 2nd Jan 2019.
* `search d/2019/01/02:2020/12/05` +
Displays all entries listed in the range 2nd Jan 2019 to 5th Dec 2020.
* `search $/250` +
Displays all entries listed with the cost range of $250.
* `search $/250:500` +
Displays all entries listed with the cost range of $250 to $500.

****
*Additional Information:* +
Searches and displays the expense along with its information, according to the user-specified command. +
If the entry is not found, it displays an appropriate error message. +
Date format is `yyyy/MM/dd` .
****

==== Sorting the expenses : `sort`

The user can sort the expenses in the list by name, date added, amount in ascending or descending order. +
Format: `sort -[n/d/$]/`

Examples:

* `sort n/` +
Sorts all entries by name (in ascending order).
* `sort d/` +
Sorts all entries by date in descending order.
* `sort $/` +
Sorts all entries by amount in ascending order.

==== Listing all expenses : `list`

Lists the expense records from newest to oldest. Use this to return to the default view after search/sort commands +
Format: `list`

==== Viewing help : `help`
Lists all the user commands with their syntax and descriptions. +
Format: `help`

==== Share feature `[coming in v2.0]`

Allows you to share your expenses with anyone, by sending them an email
including an attachment of your personal `ePiggy` data in CSV format.

=== Find Expense feature
*_ePiggy_* allows the user to filter specific expenses by entering multiple keywords. Expenses that satisfy
all the keywords are displayed in the expense list panel.

* `findExpense n/Nasi Lemak $/4.00 d/2019/04/01 t/lunch`

The above command finds expense(s) with the `Name` Nasi Lemak, `Cost` of $4.00, purchased on
`Date` 1st April, 2019 and tagged with `Tag` lunch.

[NOTE]
`Date` format is `YYYY/MM/DD`.

[TIP]
All keywords in this command are optional, provided that there is at least one input keyword. For
example, suppose we wabt to filter out all `Expense` s with `Cost` between $1 and $10.5 (both inclusive),
then the command should be just `findExpense $/1:10.5`.
Similarly for other type of keywords.

==== Current Implementation
Given below is a UML sequence diagram of how the `findExpense` command works along with a step-by-step
explanation.

image::fEuml.png[witdh="800"]

Figure: FindExpenseCommand UML Sequence Diagram +

Step 1: User enters `findExpense n/Nasi Lemak $/4.00 d/2019/04/01 t/lunch`. The command is
received by `EPiggyParser` which then creates `FindExpenseCommandParser` object and and calls
`FindExpenseCommandParser#parse()` method. +

Step 2: `FindExpenseCommandParser#parse()` first checks if input is invalid and throws a
`ParseException` otherwise it calls `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize()` to tokenize the `String` input
 into keywords and store them in an `ArgumentMultimap` Object. +

Step 3: `FindExpenseCommandParser#parse()` method then creates an `ExpenseContainsKeywordsPredicate`
Object. It implements `Predicate<Expense>` interface. It performs the filtering of expenses. +

Step 4: A `FindExpenseCommand` object is created with `ExpenseContainsKeywordsPredicate` as parameter and
returned to `LogicManager`. +

Step 5: `LogicManager` calls `FindCommand#execute()`,which then calls `Model#updateFilteredExpenseList()`
method to update the predicate of `FilteredList<Expense>`. `FilteredList` now contains only a set of
expenses which was filtered by the new predicate. +

Step 6: Expense List panel is updated by filtered set of expenses. A `CommandResult` is then created and
returned to `LogicManager`.
