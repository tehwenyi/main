== PROJECT: ePiggy

---

== Overview

ePiggy is a desktop application designed to inculcate good spending habits in students.
ePiggy hopes to make managing money much simpler for you with a simple interface and simple commands!
At the same time, ePiggy offers everything you need to cultivate good spending habits before entering the workforce,
from tracking expenses and managing budgets to setting goals! The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

---

* *Major enhancements*: added *the ability to search and sort for expenses*
** What it does: +
 1. allows the user to search for his/her expenses by either it's `name`, `cost`, `date` and/or `tag` ! +
 2. allows the user to sort his/her expenses by either it's `name`, `cost` or `date` !
** Justification: These features improves the product significantly because: +
1. It becomes more convenient for the user to find a particular expenses or a set of expenses
to figure out where he/she has been spending.
2. It becomes more convenient for the user to sort the expenses according to his/her preferences.
For example, if the user wants to find out where he/she has been spending more, the user can sort it by cost.
** Highlights: These enhancements are two of the most user-friendly commands in ePiggy, mainly due to their need and adaptability. +
1. The search feature enhancement have been built on top of the existing functionality. Now it allows multiple keywords search to filter out the
expenses. This feature searches for similar words in case the user makes a typing error. Furthermore, it allows user to
enter a range for date and cost. This implementation was quite challenging as it required the complete modification of the existing command.
2. The sort feature enhancement was built from start to finish. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives.
This new feature greatly adds to the functionality of existing commands (that were modified from address-book level 4).

* *Minor enhancement*: Added reverse list command. Modified existing help and list commands. Refactored the codebase.

* *Other contributions*:

** Project management:
*** Managed product releases on GitHub.
*** Set up the issue tracker, user stories, and assigned the milestones.

** Enhancements to existing features:
*** Made `date` an optional keyword while adding an expense.
   (so now, if the `date` keyword is missing, `date` takes the value of device's date). (Commit: https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-4/main/pull/135/commits/b974cc12cc700d751de34c80307267d26f5e455e[b974cc] )
*** Wrote base tests for any command related to `expense`, in addition to `FindExpenseCommandTest` and `SortExpenseCommandTest` .
 (Pull requests https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-4/main/pull/135[#135], https://github.com[#00])
*** Modified the search engine by make it more powerful by searching for similar words in case user makes a typo, or even when user
types a part of the keyword he/she wishes to search for.
*** Modified the storage functionality. (Pull Request https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-4/main/pull/20[#20])

** Documentation:
*** Did some UI changes to `index.html` (main page of our application).

** Community:

=== Filtering and Sorting Data

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=se]

==== Listing all expenses : `list`

Lists the expense records from newest to oldest. Use this to return to the default view after search/sort commands. +
Format: `list` or `l`

==== Listing all expenses in reverse : `reverseList`

Lists the expense records from oldest to newest. Use this to return to the default view after search/sort commands. +
Format: `reverseList`

****
*Additional Information:* +
One major use of `reverseList` command is executing it after searching/sorting the expense list.
'reverseList` and `rl` are equivalent.
****

==== Viewing help : `help`
Lists all the user commands with their syntax and descriptions. +
Format: `help`

==== Share feature `[coming in v2.0]`

Allows you to share your expenses with anyone, by sending them an email
including an attachment of your personal `ePiggy` data in CSV format.

=== Find Expense feature
*_ePiggy_* allows the user to filter specific expenses by entering multiple keywords. Expenses that satisfy
all the keywords are displayed in the expense list panel. If user has made a small typo error, we display those expenses as
well.

* `findExpense n/Nasi Lemak $/4.00 d/01/04/2019 t/lunch`

The above command finds expense(s) with the `Name` Nasi Lemak, `Cost` of $4.00, purchased on
`Date` 1st April, 2019 and tagged with `Tag` lunch.

[NOTE]
`Date` format is `dd/MM/yyyy`.

[TIP]
All keywords in this command are optional, provided that there is at least one input keyword. For
example, suppose we want to filter out all `Expense` s with `Cost` between $1 and $10.5 (both inclusive),
then the command should be just `findExpense $/1:10.5`.
Similarly for other type of keywords.

==== Current Implementation
Given below is a UML sequence diagram of how the `findExpense` command works along with a step-by-step
explanation.

image::fEuml.png[witdh="800"]

Figure: FindExpenseCommand UML Sequence Diagram +

Step 1: User enters `findExpense n/Nasi Lemak $/4.00 d/2019/04/01 t/lunch`. The command is
received by `EPiggyParser` which then creates `FindExpenseCommandParser` object and and calls
`FindExpenseCommandParser#parse()` method. +

Step 2: `FindExpenseCommandParser#parse()` first checks if input is invalid and throws a
`ParseException` otherwise it calls `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize()` to tokenize the `String` input
 into keywords and store them in an `ArgumentMultimap` Object. +

Step 3: `FindExpenseCommandParser#parse()` method then creates an `ExpenseContainsKeywordsPredicate`
Object. It implements `Predicate<Expense>` interface. It performs the filtering of expenses. +

Step 4: A `FindExpenseCommand` object is created with `ExpenseContainsKeywordsPredicate` as parameter and
returned to `LogicManager`. +

Step 5: `LogicManager` calls `FindCommand#execute()`,which then calls `Model#updateFilteredExpenseList()`
method to update the predicate of `FilteredList<Expense>`. `FilteredList` now contains only a set of
expenses which was filtered by the new predicate. +

Step 6: Expense List panel is updated by filtered set of expenses. A `CommandResult` is then created and
returned to `LogicManager`.
