This portfolio aims to document my contributions to *_ePiggy_*.

== PROJECT: ePiggy

== Overview

_ePiggy_ is a desktop application designed to inculcate good spending habits in students.
_ePiggy_ hopes to make managing money much simpler for you with a simple interface and simple commands!
At the same time, _ePiggy_ offers everything you need to cultivate good spending habits before entering the workforce,
from tracking expenses and managing budgets to setting goals! +

The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It can be used on both Windows and Mac. +

*_ePiggy_* is a product of twin modules CS2101 and CS2103T. It was transformed from the
link:https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1819S2/addressbook-level4[AddressBook - Level 4] application.

== Summary of contributions

---
This section summarises my contribution to _ePiggy_'s codebase including the newly added features and improvements over
_Address Book - Level 4_ application.

* *Major enhancements*: added *the ability to search and sort for expenses*
** What it does: +
 1. allows the user to search for his/her expenses by either it's `name`, `cost`, `date` and/or `tag` ! +
 2. allows the user to sort his/her expenses by either it's `name`, `cost` or `date` !
** Justification: These features improves the product significantly because: +
1. It becomes more convenient for the user to find a particular expenses or a set of expenses
to figure out where he/she has been spending.
2. It becomes more convenient for the user to sort the expenses according to his/her preferences.
For example, if the user wants to find out where he/she has been spending more, the user can sort it by cost.
** Highlights: These enhancements are two of the most user-friendly commands in _ePiggy_, mainly due to their need and adaptability. +
1. The search feature enhancement have been built on top of the existing functionality. Now it allows multiple keywords search to filter out the
expenses. This feature even searches for similar words in case the user makes a typing error. Furthermore, it allows user to
enter a range for date and cost. This implementation was quite challenging as it required the complete modification of the existing command.
2. The sort feature enhancement was built from scratch. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives.
This new feature greatly adds to the functionality of existing commands (that were modified from address-book level 4).

* *Minor enhancement*: Added reverse list command. Modified existing `help`, `history` and `list` commands. Refactored the codebase.
Added UI features for `expense`. [https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-4/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ExpenseCard.java[1]],

* *Other contributions*:

** Project management:
*** Managed product releases on GitHub.
*** Set up the issue tracker, user stories, and milestones.
*** Assigned bugs from other teams to respective team members.
*** Extensively tested for bugs for all features of `EPiggy`.

** Enhancements to existing features:
*** Made `date` an optional keyword while adding an expense.
   (so now, if the `date` keyword is missing, `date` takes the value of device's date). (Commit: https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-4/main/pull/135/commits/b974cc12cc700d751de34c80307267d26f5e455e[b974cc] )
*** Wrote base tests for any command related to `expense` such as [https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-4/main/blob/master/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/epiggy/ExpenseUtil.java[1]],
