== About the project

My team and I designed to modify a basic command line interface addressbook4 for our Software Engineering project.
We chose to change some logic and methods in addressbook4 so that it became a useful accounting software calls ePiggy.
The ePiggy aids to inculcate good spending habits in students. At the same time, ePiggy supports budgets, expenses and allowances management.
Student can use it to manage money easily by single and simply commands.

My role was to design and write the codes for the `*report*` and `*auto-complete*` features. The following sections
illustrate these enhancements in more detail, as well as the relevant sections I have added to the
user and developer guides in relation to these enhancements.

Note the following symbols and formatting used in this document:

[NOTE]
This symbol indicates important information.

`report` | A grey highlight (called a mark-up) indicates that this is a command
           that can be inputted into the command line and executed by the
           application.

                 the architecture of the application.

== Summary of contributions

This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation, and other helpful contributions to the
team project.

*Major enhancement*

* I added a `report` command for ePiggy: +
** What it does: The `report` command allows the user to view a report (summary) of expenses, budgets and allowance on specified date, month or year.
** Justification: If user wants to manage his/her money better, the report command enables ePiggy to generate a visualized report of specified date, month or year with different charts. The user can have a better idea of how much he/she spent or how much he/she save in that period of time.
** Highlights:
*** This command works with existing advanced features such as budget and allowance management. The implementations were challenging as it required good understanding of the addressbook4 structure and JavaFX.
*** This enhancement was built from scratch. I found my way to create a new window to show different charts and data. I tried multiply JavaFX panes to make sure that the charts and message nicely fit and display on the new window.
** Credits: JavaFX basic feature online tutorials, JavaFX advanced features (charts) tutorials.

* I added auto complete feature for ePiggy +
** What it does: user enters first few letters of the command, and then press ‘Tab’ key on the keyboard. The completed command will show on the text field.
** Justification: In case the user forgot some of the commands, he/she can quickly find the correct command format by press the ‘Tab’ key. If user forgot the parameters of the command, he/she can also use it function fill in the correct parameters of the command.

== Contributions to the User Guide

We had to update the original addressbook4 User Guide with instructions for the enhancements that
we had added. The following is an excerpt from our ePiggy User Guide, showing the details of report features and auto complete function.
